Hello, I am Hamza, a data scientist, speculative fiction writer, and erstwhile policy researcher. I often get to work with some fascinating, messy, and rich datasets and databases. 

Here are the themes I like working with: education, sports, cities, time-series (or histories as I call it), international development, innovative visualizations, climate, and assorted others. 

Here I'll be posting projects that I have finished. If you like anything, feel free to borrow for your own projects. I believe we are better off helping each other as a community. Cheers!
